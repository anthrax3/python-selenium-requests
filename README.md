python-selenium-requests
========================

Selenium is awesome, but requests makes it awesomer.  This fork ditches urllib and urllib2 to interact with remote servers and uses python-requests.  It fixed many frustrating timeout errors caused from something inside the urllib code.

```pip install -e git+ssh://git@github.com/pegler/python-selenium-requests.git#egg=selenium```


Note: this was forked and done quickly.  some code and notices may hve been (re)moved.  This was not intentional and I fully intend to clean things up soon.
